Class Takeaways:
-Program and design applications for embedded systems
-Read datasheets/manuals in order to develop practical applications
-Perform basic hardware and software debugging
-Program in C for the ARM Cortex M4 based Microcontroller
-Understand basic computing concepts such as interrupts, interrupt service routines (ISR), Memory Mapped Input/Output (I/O), simplified processor architecture, registers, program & data memory structure.
-Generate and Interpret signals to interact with the world
-UART base serial communication
-Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC)
-Input capture
-Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
-Convert C code into Assembly and Binary code
-Better identify the degree to which the Embedded Systems field aligns with their career interests


This semester in CPRE 288, we worked with a Roomba (also called a  Cybot) to strengthen our embedded systems skills. We learned to print on an LCD, move the Cybot, track push buttons, 
communicate with the Cybot, implement interrupts, use sensors, and configure serial communication with UART. We used C programming language to write code to implement our ideas on the Cybot.
My lab partner and I worked together to write and test our programs using Code Composer Studio. When complete, we sent our program to the Cybot to test our software. 
We interacted with the hardware by setting up obstacles, pressing the push buttons, and reading the LCD screen. As a computer engineering student, this class prepared me to work in the field of 
embedded systems. This class allowed me to improve my C programming skills while learning about important hardware concepts.
